<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>I led my cross-faculty team of co-authours to win the International SEEDS Award 2008 in the Leeds Laboratory project "Transition Engineering Urban Canyons". Worked closely with facullty of Manchester University, Leeds-Beckett, University of Leeds, and local governments on established urban heat island monitoring in Yorkshire. Holding both adjunct and PDRA positions at Leeds, I have collaborated in paper and research grant writing projects during lockdown. Reviewed the necessary characteristics of abandoned underground mine workngs to qualify as feasible local energy storage sites for heat and electricity. Framed the opportunity to repurpose Yorkshire legacy geoassets in the context of UK energy networks. Worked on development of “energy passports” successor of Energy Performance Certificates, contributing a decision tool to assist stakeholders decision making (retrofitting, selling/buying/renting) for EnergyLeeds local energy systems team. .</p>
