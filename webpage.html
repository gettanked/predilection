<h1>Workshop Application</h1>
<p>Unlocking the Benefits of Urban Green and Blue Spaces - Scoping workshops
</p>
  <p>Thank you for applying to attend these events. A copy of the details we received are shown below.
</p>
  <p>Name:	Dr Eric Peterson
</p>
  <p>Organisation:	University of Leeds
</p>
  <p>Department:	School of Biology
</p>
  <p>Job title:	Visiting Research Fellow, Bioclimatic Design and Blue-Green Infrastructure
</p>
  <p>Email:	e.peterson@leeds.ac.uk

</p>
  <p>Council alignment:	EPSRC; NERC</p><p>
</p>
  <p>Relevant expertise:	I develop and manage progressive and quantitative solutions of biology and engineering problems across the disciplines of Mechanical, Environmental and Architectural Engineering, with specialist expertise in building services, blue-green infrastructure, marine aquaculture, and desalination – all with reference to sustainability, adaptation, and nature-based opportunities. Qualifications: PhD, Aquacultural Enginering, James Cook Univ., Townsville, Australia (JCU), 1999 First Class Hons. (summa cum laude) Enviro Eng, Michigan Technological Univ. 1994 BSci Mech Eng, University of Massachusetts at Amherst 1982 (Energy/thermo-fluids) RPEQ (Australia & NZ) 1989- ; PE (USA) Environmental & Mechanical Engineer 1989- Commissions of Trust and Professional Engagement Voting Member of ASHRAE Technical Committee for Climatic Data (TC4.2), 2017-.. Member, Global Association for Transition Engineering (UK Reg Charity No.1166048) Past-Member, Editorial Board of the Journal of Aquacultural Engineering 
</p>
  <p>Interdisciplinary expertise:	I led my cross-faculty team of co-authours to win the International SEEDS Award 2008 in the Leeds Laboratory project "Transition Engineering Urban Canyons". Worked closely with facullty of Manchester University, Leeds-Beckett, University of Leeds, and local governments on established urban heat island monitoring in Yorkshire. Holding both adjunct and PDRA positions at Leeds, I have collaborated in paper and research grant writing projects during lockdown. Reviewed the necessary characteristics of abandoned underground mine workngs to qualify as feasible local energy storage sites for heat and electricity. Framed the opportunity to repurpose Yorkshire legacy geoassets in the context of UK energy networks. Worked on development of “energy passports” successor of Energy Performance Certificates, contributing a decision tool to assist stakeholders decision making (retrofitting, selling/buying/renting) for EnergyLeeds local energy systems team. 
</p>
  <p>Current collaborations:	Voting Member of ASHRAE Technical Committee for Climatic Data (TC4.2), I am tasked with representing issues beyond North America. TC4.2 has been repeatedly updating global built environment design data every 4 years. I organised ASHRAE conference seminar “Would Your Building Perform Satisfactorily During a Heatwave or Power-Blackout?” together with ASU Professor David Sailor this year as well as “Hotter Cities, Hotter Climates: Modelling and Measuring Urban Heat Island Effects Around the World” last year with Ben-Gurion Uni Professor Avyatar Erell. Member, Global Association for Transition Engineering (transitionengineering.org) Well-respected for service as Member, Editorial Board of the Journal of Aquacultural Engineering (2000-2015) 
</p>
  <p>Rationale for attending:	I suggest collaboration with whom may be concerned with IPCC 2022 AR6 WG3 Buildings GHG emissions assessment in terms of Sufficiency, Efficiency, Renewable (SER). Sufficiency measures tackle GHG emissions by limiting the demand for energy and materials over the lifecycle of buildings and appliances (high confidence). The SER hierarchy of mitigation strategies is framed so heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) are reserved for situations where passive and low energy alternatives would not suffice, in which case energy efficient equipment and buildings should be promoted. Under SER, the installation of on-site renewable energy generation such as rooftop panels are viewed as the final step – after sufficiency and efficiency measures have been maximised. I argue that blue-green solutions have the potential to support sufficiency and effi! ciency goals to mitigate the impacts of climage change, as well adaptation. So I would like to promote my global analysis of where air-conditioning is not necessary https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2022.112088 Energy and Buildings, and collaborate on follow-up case-studies. 
</p>
  <p>Workshop choice:	9 June; 16 June
</p>
  <p>Comments on choice:	I would prefer to make my presentation from my home office in Yorkshire 9 June Sorry I will be travelling 14 June at the time of the China workshop. I will be on the east coast of USA and logging in 16 June, able to answer queries and otherwise engage.
